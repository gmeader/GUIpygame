GUI toolkit  for PyGame. 
It is widget-based, and uses pygame events for communication, so that it can easily be dropped into an existing pygame program, without taking over the event loop. It supports forms, buttons, windows, modal & non-modal message boxes & dialog boxes, vertical menus, text-entry boxes, and sliders (scroll bars). It smoothly handles overlapping controls, and forms-within forms.
